# VaultSeek Development Roadmap

Version: 1.1

Status: Active development

Overall Progress: 42%

---

# Purpose

This document acts as the project's persistent engineering notebook.

Unlike PROJECT_PLAN.md and ARCHITECTURE.md, which define long-term design decisions, this document tracks implementation progress.

Every AI coding session should begin by reading this file.

Also read ARCHITECTURAL_UPDATE_001.md (Acquisition Engine / AcquisitionJob).

Update this document whenever major milestones are completed.

# Current Project Status

Project State

🟢 Active

Current Phase

Phase 4 transport + Phases 9–10 verification/import hand-off

Current Sprint

Sprint 3

Current Goal

Companion Nicotine+ NDJSON plugin (or HTTP api-nicotine-plus adapter);
wishlist / acquisition UI; auto-acquire above threshold.
---

# Vision Statement

MusicVault manages an existing music library.

VaultSeek discovers and acquires missing music.

The two applications should eventually share a common reusable core while remaining independent applications.

---

# Guiding Principles

Every architectural decision should support:

Modularity

Extensibility

Maintainability

Testability

AI-assisted development

Provider independence

Code clarity

Long-term sustainability

---

# Architecture Decisions (DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT REVIEW)

Decision #001

VaultSeek uses a Provider Framework.

Approved

Reason

Allows multiple download providers without changing the application core.

---

Decision #002

The first provider is Nicotine+.

Approved

Reason

Leverages an existing mature implementation instead of immediately implementing the Soulseek protocol.

---

Decision #003

Search generation is provider-independent.

Approved

Providers translate SearchRequests into provider-specific implementations.

---

Decision #004

Downloaded files are always verified before import.

Approved

Verification is mandatory.

---

Decision #005

Business logic belongs in Services.

Approved

ViewModels remain presentation-only.

---

Decision #006

Everything should be asynchronous.

Approved

Never block the UI thread.

---

Decision #007

Dependency Injection is required.

Approved

Avoid direct instantiation of services.

---

Decision #008

SOLID principles are mandatory.

Approved

---

Decision #009

Composition is preferred over inheritance.

Approved

---

Decision #010

AI readability takes precedence over code cleverness.

Approved

---

# Session Notes

## 2026-07-20 — Phase 1 + Acquisition foundation

Summary

- Forked MusicVault → VaultSeek at `C:\Users\user\Projects\VaultSeek`.
- Rebranded `musicvault` → `vaultseek`; data dir `%APPDATA%\VaultSeek`.
- Imported planning docs + ARCHITECTURAL_UPDATE_001; ADR-0016, ADR-0017.
- AcquisitionProvider Protocol, ProviderManager, stub provider.
- AcquisitionJob state machine + in-memory AcquisitionEngine.
- Local commit `926777a` pushed to https://github.com/oceanmasterza/VaultSeek (`origin/master` in sync).

Recommended refactors (no user-visible change, before new features)

- Rename pipeline `Job` references in UI to avoid confusion with `AcquisitionJob` (internal only).
- Add `acquisition_jobs` DB table before wiring Missing Media Analyzer.
- Route future search/download through AcquisitionEngine only (never UI → Provider).

Next session goal

Persist AcquisitionJob + Missing Media Analyzer.

---

## 2026-07-20 — Phase 2: Persist jobs + gap analyzer

Summary

- Added `acquisition_jobs` table (Alembic 0006) + `AcquisitionJobRepository`.
- Refactored `AcquisitionEngine` to persist via repository (same public API).
- `MissingMediaAnalyzer` compares library tracklists vs MusicBrainz; `create_jobs_for_library` creates MISSING_TRACK jobs.
- Wired repo + analyzer in `Container`.

Recommended refactors (non-user-visible)

- `SearchDispatcher` should advance job state and store raw results in `job.extra` (Phase 6).
- Connect acquisition providers from config on bootstrap (Phase 3).

Next session goal

Provider config hardening, Nicotine+ skeleton, search/scoring/download skeletons.

---

## 2026-07-20 — Phases 3–8 skeletons

Summary

- `AcquisitionConfig` / schema v8 + bootstrap `connect_acquisition_providers`.
- `NicotinePlusProvider` skeleton (TCP probe; graceful without client).
- `SearchDispatcher`, `ScoringEngine`, `DownloadManager` wired in `Container`.
- 574 tests passing.

Recommended refactors (non-user-visible)

- Persist search results on `AcquisitionJob.extra` during COLLECTING_RESULTS.
- Replace sync Nicotine+ probe with real RPC when API surface is chosen.
- Persist download handles (survive restart).

Next session goal

Verification + import pipeline integration; real Nicotine+ search/download.


---

## 2026-07-20 — Phases 9–10: Verification + Import skeletons

Summary

- `VerificationEngine` + `VerificationResult` (path checks, metadata hints, stubs).
- `ImportPipeline` + `ImportResult` with mandatory `run_after_verification` gate.
- Wired in `Container`; unit tests for pass/fail/complete paths.

Recommended refactors (non-user-visible)

- Persist `local_paths` on `AcquisitionJob.extra` when downloads complete.
- Replace fingerprint/duplicate stubs with FingerprintWorker + DuplicateMatcher.
- Hand off ImportPipeline to OrganizerWorker / ArtworkWorker / MediaServerWorker.

Also added

- `DownloadManager.complete` persists `local_paths` and advances to VERIFYING.
- `AcquisitionWorkflow.finish_download` chains verify→import.

Next session goal

Also added NicotinePlusRpcClient / FakeRpcClient injection point.

Next session goal

Implement real Nicotine+ RPC transport; harden verification with fingerprints.


---

## 2026-07-20 — Nicotine+ NDJSON transport + verify/import hand-off

Summary

- Researched Nicotine+: no official TCP/JSON RPC; community `api-nicotine-plus`
  is HTTP on 12339. VaultSeek defines a clear NDJSON socket protocol.
- `LocalSocketRpcClient` (graceful offline) + working `FakeRpcClient` path.
- `VerificationEngine`: SHA-256 duplicate checks via `DuplicateRepository`,
  embedded tags via `LocalTagsProvider`, optional Chromaprint fingerprint
  duplicate checks (soft-skip when fpcalc unavailable).
- `ImportPipeline`: stages verified files into library Incoming and enqueues
  `SCAN_DIRECTORY` (existing organize/artwork/media-server chain); optional
  `SYNC_MEDIA_SERVER`.
- Wired in `Container`.

Recommended refactors (non-user-visible)

- Ship or document a Nicotine+ companion plugin that speaks the NDJSON protocol
  (or adapt `HttpApiRpcClient` to palaueb/api-nicotine-plus).
- Persist verification digests on `AcquisitionJob.extra`.
- Defer media-server sync until organize completes (today optional early enqueue).

Next session goal

Companion plugin / HTTP adapter; acquisition UI; auto-acquire threshold.

# Golden Rule

Never sacrifice architecture for speed.

Every feature should make VaultSeek easier to extend.

If an implementation makes future providers harder to add, redesign it before writing code.

Build foundations first.

Features come second.
